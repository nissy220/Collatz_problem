-Explanation of files.
1. calc_stopping_time.py: A code to estimate the total stopping time distribution and the max of the total stopping time analytically.
2. Function_of_stopping_time.pdf: A note about the function to estimate the total stopping time.
3. result(3-point moving average).png: An example of comparison of the Collatz sequences result (3-point moving average) and function calculation result.
